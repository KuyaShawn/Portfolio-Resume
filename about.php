                Greetings! my name is Eashune Abenojar. And thank you for viewing my website I hope
                you enjoy it!
                <br><br>
                I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science at Green River College. From a young age, I've had a strong
                interest in programming and I've found it to be a great way to solve many problems. Programming has
                always been a way for me to let my creativity flow, and it is something I am very passionate about.
                <br><br>
                My academic and professional experiences have enabled me to develop valuable skills, and I would like to
                augment my implementation of such skills by working in a formal environment, preferably in the areas of
                back-end development or full-stack development.
                <br><br>
                As a quick learner ready to acclimate to any environment and someone who looks forward to challenges, I
                hope to leverage my analytical and creative skills to work on meaningful projects and to gain new
                experiences. Feel free to connect with me or contact me through email at EashuneAbenojar@hotmail.com
                regarding any inquiries or opportunities.

                            <p>
                                After graduating, I didn't know what i've wanted to do after
                                High school. But after taking an HTML course at Highline College. I've researched the
                                Computer Science major, and that's when I became interested in pursuing this major.

                            <p>
                                During my years in Highline, I grew to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL,
                                and Java. And with the help of these projects and classes, I've become more accustomed
                                to wanting to learn more and get better at coding with multiple languages. And besides.
                                those CS
                                classes it helped me gain a few minor projects to add to my collection of repos in
                                GitHub.

                            <p>
                                I Joined Green river college to progress my knowledge in Software Development and pursue
                                a bachelor’s degree in Software Development. In my time here, I have learned how to
                                strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Java. Not only that, I learned
                                how to use PHP properly in order to build a secured website for a company with the
                                resources we had like a server & mentors. Besides learning a new language, I also
                                learned how to use and create a proper Data Structure using the Java language.

                                Finally, with the help of a helpful course called Software career prep. I was able to
                                create a proper resume with all of my important info and skills that I’ve worked on, to
                                help give me a stepping stone in the CS field.

                    For my first project I created my first website using the basics of HTML,
                    CSS, and JavaScript. It isn&apos;t a great website, but it was a start of
                    something new, which I then got very interested in. I put a lot of effort
                    into this as a newcomer to programming, but I&apos;m happy how it sorta
                    turned out

                    For my second project, for Java 1 I&apos;ve created an art project that used
                    an &quot;acm&quot; file for graphic/animation designs. This was an overall
                    fun project for Java 1 and I plan to create more as a little practice

                    For my Third project, for Java 2 I&apos;ve created a basic GUI file that
                    takes in order list. by letting the user choose what type of drink they
                    wanted and which assortment they wanted to add into their drink, this GUI
                    had a working quantity inputter, cost calculation, etc.&nbsp;
