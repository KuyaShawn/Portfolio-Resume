        <h4>Food Service Worker</h4>
        <p>
            My role in the foodservice is to help bring food to the designated areas
            within the hospital. While also working as a team to deliver the food to the
            patients. Also, it&apos;s my job to help get the food prepared and organized
            for the patient. And some time to time I will help within the dish room.

        <h4>Customer Site Warehouse Support</h4>
        <p>
            During my whole time working at Fastenal as a Part-Timer. I was able to
            learn plenty of things, such as taking deliveries, making orders, make
            branch transfers, receive in orders/transfers, and learning how to
            communicate as a team while also learning how to become a leader when
            someone doesn&apos;t know what to do. For deliveries my job was to take in
            the orders I&apos;ve or someone else picked the day before. And then I go
            out and deliver the parts such as gloves, wrenches, nuts, bolts, and screws
            to the company that wanted those items. Sometimes my manager tells me to
            receive and it&rsquo;s a pretty easy job, as all I do is scan the parts that
            have been sent by the company. Branch transfers, which is picking items and
            making custom shipping labels for other Fastenal companies to sell to their
            customers. There is a lot of heavy equipment &amp; boxes that are needed to
            be moved around within the warehouse, so dealing with heavy things is very
            common for me to work around with.

        <p class="statment_P">
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
                Being born as a foreigner and being from a low-income family household. I
                wouldn&rsquo;t have dreamt of being in college and having an &ldquo;American
                Dream&rdquo;, not until I&rsquo;ve realized that I can change that dream and
                turn it into reality. When I was the age of three, I moved from the
                Philippines to the US with my mother, my father had the money to bring us
                here to the US as his side of the family was well off. But because my father
                was the only one who was generating the income, it was hard for us to only
                depend on him, so my mother took her time to find a job while also trying
                her best to teach me some English words that she remembered learned from
                school so that when I start school I would be at least ready to communicate
                with other students and the teacher. As I started elementary school, I had a
                hard time making friends and communicating with them due to a language
                barrier and as kids, some would make fun of my accent and my inability of
                speaking English, so they placed me into an ESL class and within time and
                practice I&rsquo;ve gotten better with my English and understanding the
                things around me. One day my parent gifted me my first device with a few
                games, the console&nbsp;was called&nbsp;a Nintendo DS. As this was my first
                console, the first thing I did to it was to fidget around with it and learn
                how to make it work since I had no clue on how to use it, when I figured out
                how to use it I was very excited. One day I was curious about how this
                device worked so I played around with it until it broke, I was a little
                saddened that my DS broke, but my father showed me that things could always
                be fixed, so he demonstrated to me how to replace a battery on the DS. At
                that moment that&rsquo;s when I caught on to learning how to fix things by
                replacing the batteries off non-working devices like a remote.

        <p class="statment_P">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During my time in middle school,
                I took a computer class that guided us on how to use the Windows operating
                system, the internet, and how to secure yourself from malicious programs and
                scammers. This class is what sparked my interest in how computers worked,
                and because I liked fixing things, I&rsquo;ve always wondered how people
                fixed things within the internet. So then, I came looking for answers, and
                as you know the almighty google has shown me careers that&rsquo;s associated
                with computers and the internet, as a kid I was fascinated with the word
                &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; and I learned that cybersecurity was that hacker job
                that fits my desired career. But as time goes on, I&rsquo;ve become more
                familiar with how the Operating systems and internet works, and during my
                spare time after school, I would try to learn how to code through google
                chrome&rsquo;s developer tool. As I continue to practice and use this tool,
                I become more interested in wanting to develop my own apps and software. And
                so, I&rsquo;ve made it a goal after high school that I would become a
                software developer. Not only that I&rsquo;ve always had it as a goal to make
                my parents proud for their hard work, and I&rsquo;ve always wanted to repay
                that hardship by showing them I will succeed and help make their lives
                easier with my future career, as I plan on developing an app that would help
                benefit them. This Is when I realized that my dream is becoming more of a
                reality as I slowly step forward closer to it. There will be roadblocks
                achieving this dream, but I know for a fact that It will be worth it at the
                end.
